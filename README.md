# Fake ID Detection

The proposed system for detecting fake social media profiles uses a deep learning approach to identify deceptive profiles effectively. This project involves meticulous data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the construction of a deep learning model tailored for fake profile detection.

## Abstract

The system begins with data preprocessing where training and testing datasets are loaded and formatted using Pandas. The dataset is standardized using StandardScaler to enhance model performance. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using visualizations such as count plots and correlation matrices to understand key features and uncover patterns.

A deep learning model is then constructed using TensorFlow and Keras. The neural network includes multiple dense layers with ReLU activation functions and dropout layers to mitigate overfitting. The model is compiled with a suitable loss function and optimizer for binary classification.

Training and evaluation are conducted rigorously, with performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report being analyzed. The system also provides a comprehensive performance analysis to aid in understanding the model’s learning dynamics and fine-tuning its parameters.
